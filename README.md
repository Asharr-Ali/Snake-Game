# Snake Game 🐍

This project is a classic **Snake Game** built using **C++**, developed as part of my programming coursework. The game features real-time user interaction, keyboard controls, and basic game mechanics like food spawning, score tracking, and snake movement.

## 🎮 Game Controls

- Use **arrow keys** to move the snake (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️).
- Eat the food to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid crashing into the walls or yourself — or it's game over!

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asharr-Ali/Snake-Game.git
